    //Need to make sure somewhere that when a ghost marker is selected, it first of all creates a KNOT!

    //On shift delete
    //1- Delete Knots but not markers.
    //2- Change markers to "Ghost" on their entity.
    //3- Calculate their ratio.
    //4- Get their position (EvaluatePosition)
    //5- Apply that position to markers.
